# Test Details

Devops to Celer is about automating the provisioning of resources as much as possible.

The test is to illustrate the automated provisioning onto a single server with the following resources:
- A load balancer (HAProxy) 
- Three separate Elasticsearch nodes running in a cluster
- The entry point to the cluster should be HTTP 9200/TCP

If you wish, you may use a configuration management tool like Ansible


## Context
We are testing your ability to implement automated infrastructure, as well as general knowledge of system administration. We are looking for readability and maintainability of your solution

## Submit your solution
Create a public Github repository and push your solution in it. Commit often - we would rather see a history of trial and error than a single monolithic push. When you're finished, send us the URL to the repository.
